# ERC smart contracts

### fungible tokens (ERC20) and non fungible tokens (ERC721) or NFTs

The basic difference you find in ERC20 vs. ERC721 comparisons would directly point to the fungibility of ERC-20 tokens. On the other hand, ERC-721 tokens are non-fungible. While ERC-20 tokens represent a single asset and are interchangeable, ERC-721 tokens are indivisible and represent a collection of assets.

The ERC20 and ERC-721 tokens are the foundations of the thriving Ethereum ecosystem. They provide the foundation for defining smart contracts, which are the core elements in modern blockchain-based decentralized applications.

# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

## How to use it?

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

## Notes

Since TypeScript is supported out of the box with Next.js, all we have to do is to install TypeScript.

```
npm install --save-dev typescript
```
